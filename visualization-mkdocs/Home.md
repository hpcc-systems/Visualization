The _HPCC Visualisation Framework_ provides a comprehensive set of visualizations, adhering to a consistent set of interfaces. It includes wrappers for third party chart libraries (Google, C3 Charts, AM Charts etc.) as well as home grown visualizations (watch this space).
It also adds a set of connectors and marshallers to make connecting visualizations to the HPCC Platform a trivial excercise.
