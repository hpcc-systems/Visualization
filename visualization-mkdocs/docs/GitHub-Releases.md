This page will detail how a user can download the Visualisation framework from [here](https://github.com/hpcc-systems/Visualization/releases) and, from there, how to use the framework in this context. 


## Locally 

To use the framework locally, firstly unzip the compressed file that you have downloaded. Before jumping straight into building your own set of widgets and visualisation, we will take a tour of how it is already implemented in the downloaded framework. So, to begin, change into the demos directory 

    cd demos 

Open the file ``` test.html ``` which should launch in your preferred web browser. What should be observed is a set of widgets, so you can look through these ones to see what you like. In fact, there is another file ``` dermatology.html``` that holds a comprehensive list of all developed widgets that have been developed and that can viewed at your own leisure. 

Now, let's use the framework to build our own first widget. In the folder ```demos``` make a file 

    touch new_widget.html

and open in your favourite text editor. Say we want to make the hello world widget, then we should paste the code from [here](https://github.com/hpcc-systems/Visualization/wiki#getting-started) into ``` new_widget.html ``` and just open it in the web browser in the exact same we did with ``` test.html ```. 

Now, understanding how to build the hello world example, we can now move onto more complicated and complicated examples, but in essence, that is the way in which we use the visualisation framework within this context.
